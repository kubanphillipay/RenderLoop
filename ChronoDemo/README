This is a work in progress.

I wanted to check the possiblity of creating a render loop using std::chrono and std::thread::sleep_for to reduce power usage.  This code is a little buggy mainly because it uses the console for printing and NOT a graphics program.  My goal is to integrate Open GL and GLFW into the program over the next few days.
